# Django-REST-API - Finished 06/09/2020

This project is a Django rest API with a docker compose for the CI/CD management.
I built it for a take home assignement during the interview process of 'UPciti'.

The data need to be downloaded via the link in the 'data/readme'.
Be careful with the size of the data and the Memory allocated to your docker container.
